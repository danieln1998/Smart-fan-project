# Smart-fan-project


The fan has 3 modes:

Always works
always off
Works above a certain temp
When the fan is working, the operation is for 2 seconds and then a 4 second break

The system includes:

Fan
temp sensor
Two buttons

To determine the mode of operation of the fan, we will use a web page, which both displays the currently active mode, and also allows entering the operating temperature

Access to this page is from a close distance, that is, working in local server mode on the Arduino

This page will also include the buttons that enable turning on and off and controlling the fan

also:

Pressing the red button switches to off mode

Pressing the green button switches to continuous operation mode

Pressing the two buttons switches to working mode according to temp (with the temp entered on the web page)
